## Usage

### Registering

To use the `Finturest.Country` client, register it in your application's dependency injection container using `AddFinturestCountry`. This configures the services required to communicate with the Finturest Country API.

```C#
var services = new ServiceCollection();

services.AddFinturestCountry(options =>
{
    options.ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
});
```

> **Note**  
> `ICountryServiceClient` is registered in the DI container and should be resolved via dependency injection.  
> In ASP.NET Core applications, it's recommended to inject it through constructor injection.

> **Note**  
> The abstractions for the Finturest Country API client are provided in a separate package named `Finturest.Country.Abstractions`.  
> You can reference this package in your business layer to avoid a tight dependency on the implementation.  
> Only the root application or composition root should reference the full `Finturest.Country` package that contains the implementation.

### Get countries

To get countries using the Finturest Country API, call the `GetCountriesAsync` method on the `ICountryServiceClient`.

```C#
var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

var countryServiceClient = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ICountryServiceClient>();

var result = await countryServiceClient.GetCountriesAsync();

Console.WriteLine($"Countries: {result.Count}.");
```

> **Note**  
> In production applications, avoid using `BuildServiceProvider()` manually.  
> Instead, use constructor injection to get `ICountryServiceClient` from the frameworkâ€™s dependency injection system.
